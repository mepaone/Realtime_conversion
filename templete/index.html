        An application is to be developed to represent dynamic functionalities like online currency converter. The
application can simultaneously convert to currency using an online information source.
Different countries use different currencies and these currencies change daily compared to each other. Those who
have transferred money (one currency to another) from one country to another must be updated with the latest
currency exchange rates in the market.
With this in mind, the Currency Converter project has been created. This is just an app development like a calculator
using Python. In this application, there are regular updates about each country's currency by which it reflects the
current currency market value and conversion rate.
